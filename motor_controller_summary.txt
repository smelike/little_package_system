Motor Controller Project - Instruction Summary
===========================

1. Read and complete the task described in the input text file.

2. Extract all MODBUS commands for each hardware component and organize them in a structured `commands.yaml` file.

3. Implement an automatic CRC16 wrapper to apply checksums to all MODBUS commands before transmission.

4. Create a real-time command generator that reads from the `commands.yaml` entries and builds valid MODBUS frames.

5. Package the full project into a clean, ready-to-use ZIP archive with proper folder structure and dependencies.

6. Apply the Singleton pattern in the base serial device class to ensure only one connection exists per (port, baudrate) configuration â€” useful for shared COM bus scenarios.

7. Include detailed exception handling using structured error codes and messages. Errors should propagate clearly from the hardware layer up to application level.

8. Create an `error_codes.py` file to define all relevant error messages and codes for debugging and fault tracking.

9. Extend the `MotorController` class with a method to initialize control modes (`2006H`) to one of: Modbus-485, IO control, keyboard, or encoder switch.

10. Refactor `MotorController` to use a cache-address-driven architecture with semantic mappings for MODBUS commands.

11. Create a general-purpose function for dynamically generating MODBUS commands, supporting extensibility and reuse.

12. During initialization, `MotorController` should automatically set its control mode to Modbus-485.

13. Before any cache write, `MotorController` must enable writable communication by writing `0001` to cache address `200EH`, and should only do this once per session.
